## Use the SDKs

IDOL Eduction and KeyView Filter are designed to be embedded into other services.  For example, OpenText IDOL embeds the both SDKs into [NiFi processors](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_23_2/NiFiIngest_23.2_Documentation/Help/Content/Walkthrough/BuildBasicPipeline.htm) to be used in data transformation workflows.

Many other OpenText products also embed Eduction and KeyView Filter to enhance their capabilities.  ISVs also license Eduction and KeyView Filter, embedding the SDKs into their applications and services for:

- data loss prevention (DLP) and other security and information governance needs,
- document / content management,
- archiving and eDiscovery, and
- many other use cases.

### IDOL Eduction

Use the SDK to perform extraction and more.

[Get started](./eduction/README.md#use-the-eduction-sdk).

### KeyView Filter

Use the SDK to work with your files.
