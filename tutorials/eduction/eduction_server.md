# Eduction Server

The Eduction ACI Server is a stand-alone server that uses the IDOL ACI infrastructure. It is one of the available options that you have to run Eduction.

In this lesson, you will:

- Learn about the key features of an ACI server.
- Configure and start Eduction Server with your OEM license key.
- Explore the ACI API SDK for C to allow communication with Eduction Server.
- Use the include Python wrapper for the ACI API to perform Eduction.

This guide assumes you have already completed both:
- the introductory Eduction [tutorial](./introduction.md), and
- the ACI API introductory tutorial [Python example](../../resources/aci_api/Python/README.md).

## Setup

Before you continue with this lesson, refer to the [documentation links](#see-also) below.

### Download ACI SDK for C, Eduction Server & Grammars

Download software from the [Software Licensing and Downloads](https://sld.microfocus.com/mysoftware/index) portal.

1. Under the *Downloads* tab, select your product, product name and version from the dropdowns:

    ![get-software](../../figs/get-software.png)

1. From the list of available files, select and download the following (depending on your platform):
   -  `IDOLCSDK_23.3.0_{PLATFORM}`, *e.g.* `IDOLCSDK_23.3.0_WINDOWS_X86_64.zip`,
   -  `EductionServer_23.3.0_{PLATFORM}`, *e.g.* `EductionServer_23.3.0_WINDOWS_X86_64.zip`,
   -  `EductionGrammars_23.3.0_COMMON.zip` (if you don't already have a copy from the introductory tutorial), and
   -  `Versionkey_23.3.0_COMMON.zip`.

    > NOTE: you should have already downloaded the C API package while following the ACI API introductory [tutorial](../aci_api/introduction.md#download-idol-components).

### Install IDOL components

1. Copy your downloaded files into a new working folder.  The follow guide assumes this is `C:\OpenText` on Windows.
1. Extract the `.zip` files to give you:
   - `C:\OpenText\IDOLCSDK_23.3.0_WINDOWS_X86_64`,
   - `C:\OpenText\EductionServer_23.3.0_WINDOWS_X86_64`, and
   - `C:\OpenText\EductionGrammars_23.3.0_COMMON`
  
1. Copy your OEM license key `.dat` file into `C:\OpenText\EductionServer_23.3.0_WINDOWS_X86_64` and rename it to `licensekey.dat`.
   
    > NOTE: obtain this key as described in ACI API introductory [tutorial](../aci_api/introduction.md#obtain-an-oem-license-key).

1. Extract the file `versionkey.dat` from `Versionkey_23.3.0_COMMON.zip`, then copy that file into `C:\OpenText\EductionServer_23.3.0_WINDOWS_X86_64` as described in the [IDOL Release Notes - Licensing](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_23_3/IDOLReleaseNotes_23.3_Documentation/idol/Content/Upgrade/Licenses.htm).

1. On Windows, you may need to install the included Visual C++ Redistributable package.  In the same Eduction Server folder, right-click on `vcredist_2017.exe` then select 'Run as administrator'.
   
    > HINT: If you see a version conflict error here, you may need to first uninstall any existing version.

## IDOL ACI Servers

All IDOL ACI servers include, *e.g.* under the directory: `C:\OpenText\EductionServer_23.3.0_WINDOWS_X86_64`:
- an executable, *e.g.* `eductionserver.exe`, and
- a primary configuration file, *e.g.* `eductionserver.cfg`.

An ACI server can be launched by running the executable or by configuring a service on [Windows](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_23_3/IDOLServer_23.3_Documentation/Guides/html/gettingstarted/Content/Shared_Admin/Installation/_ADM_Install_WindowsServices.htm) or on [Linux](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_23_3/IDOLServer_23.3_Documentation/Guides/html/gettingstarted/Content/Shared_Admin/Installation/_ADM_Install_LinuxStartup.htm).

Where you have an OEM license key, the ACI server looks on startup for a `licensekey.dat` file in the same directory as the executable.

> NOTE: With a non-OEM license, the primary configuration file must be modified to reference an instance of IDOL License Server, which is contacted to received permission to run.  Use of IDOL License Server is beyond the scope of this lesson.

## Configuring Eduction Grammars

As will now be familiar, Eduction grammars are supplied separately in the `EductionGrammars_23.3.0_COMMON.zip` container. 

Edit the `eductionserver.cfg` as follows:
```diff
-ResourceFiles=grammars/internet.ecr
+ResourceFiles=../EductionGrammars_23.3.0_COMMON/general/grammars/internet.ecr
```

The `[Eduction]` section of this configuration file should look familiar to you from the introduction, as the configuration of Resource Files and Entities is the same.

Note some important additional sections:

- The Service and Server ports that Eduction Server will listen on to receive requests from an ACI client:

    ```ini
    [Service]
    ServicePort=13001

    [Server]
    Port=13000
    ```

- IP address/range restrictions for clients to have requests accepted by the ACI server:

    ```ini
    [AuthorizationRoles]
    0=AdminRole
    1=QueryRole

    [AdminRole]
    StandardRoles=admin,servicecontrol,query,servicestatus
    Clients=localhost
    ...
    ```

- The log files that Eduction Server will write out to:

    ```ini
    [Logging]
    LogDirectory=./logs
    0=ApplicationLogStream
    1=EductionLogStream
    2=QueryLogStream
    ```

## Run Eduction Server

For the simplest start, now double-click the `eductionserver.exe`.

Open the `logs/application.log` file to see amount other messages, the following line:

```
This ACI Server will not accept unencrypted communications from ACI clients.
```

This line means that your Eduction Server has successfully picked up up the OEM license key and is ready to accept encrypted requests from an ACI client.

## Perform Eduction via the ACI API

The ACI (Autonomy Content Infrastructure) Client API enables easy communication between custom-built applications and IDOL ACI servers.

You should already be familiar with the Python ACI API wrapper, which is included in this tutorial package under `resources/aci_api/Python`.

Now that you're set up with Eduction Server and the Python ACI API, it's time to run something useful.  The included scripts directory contains a file to do just that: `educe_from_text_oem.py`.

This script uses the `call()` function to run Eduction Server's `EduceFromText` action, submitting a text string to be analyzed, as well as the entity type to be educed, as follows:

```py
aci_params = {
  "Text": "Simon received emails from christopher.blanks@opentext.com and chris.blanks@opentext.com today.",
  "Entities": "internet/addr_email"
}
```  

> NOTE: Remember that Eduction Server's default configuration file included the `internet.ecr` grammar file, from which we're using the email entity as a test.

As previously, you must set the value of the `encryption_key` parameter to the long string found in your `OEMstring.txt` file:

  ```diff
  - encryption_key="REPLACE_WITH_MY_LONG_KEY_STRING",
  + encryption_key="NTI6MXyE...3dheAQC"
  ```

Run the script to see the output from Eduction Server:

```
> python educe_from_text_oem.py 
offset,match,score
26,christopher.blanks@opentext.com,1.0
64,chris.blanks@opentext.com,1.0
```

For more details on running the "EduceFromText" action and its optional parameters, please read the [reference guide](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_23_3/EductionServer_23.3_Documentation/Help/Content/Actions/Eduction/EduceFromText.htm).

## Conclusion

You now understand how to license and run Eduction Server in an OEM deployment to receive ACI-encrypted requests from an ACI client to perform Eduction from sample text.

Next, why not try more tutorials to explore some of the other features available in IDOL Eduction, linked from the [showcase](../README.md#idol-eduction-showcase) page.
