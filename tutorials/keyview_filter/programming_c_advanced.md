## Using a custom stream

Until now, you have been operating exclusively on files on disk. However, there are many situations where the information is not stored in this way â€“ perhaps it is being read from a network, or output by another operation. In these cases, you might want to use KeyView in stream mode.

### Defining a custom stream

You can implement a custom stream by filling out a [KVInputStream](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_13/KeyviewFilterSDK_12.13_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/index.html#C/filtering_structures/KVInputStream.htm) structure with functions that perform the appropriate actions. Each of these are equivalent to the ANSI counterparts (fopen, fread, and so on), except several functions return a BOOL rather than an error code.

To illustrate how to use a custom stream, the following example defines a very simple stream that forwards to the file-based operations.

```c
typedef struct
{
    char* filename;
    FILE* fp;
} StreamInfo;

BOOL pascal streamOpen(KVInputStream* stream)
{
    if(!stream || !stream.pInputStreamPrivateData)
    {
        return FALSE;
    }
    
    StreamInfo* info = (StreamInfo*)stream.pInputStreamPrivateData;
    
    info.fp = fopen(info.filename);
    return info.fp != NULL;
}

UINT pascal streamRead(KVInputStream* stream, BYTE * buffer, UINT size)
{
    if(!stream || !stream.pInputStreamPrivateData)
    { 
        return 0;
    }
    StreamInfo* info = (StreamInfo*)stream.pInputStreamPrivateData;
    return fread(buffer, 1, size, info.fp);
}

BOOL pascal streamSeek (KVInputStream* stream, long offset, int whence)
{
    if(!stream || !stream.pInputStreamPrivateData)
    { 
        return FALSE;
    }
    
    StreamInfo* info = (StreamInfo*)stream.pInputStreamPrivateData;

    return fseek(info.fp, offset, whence);
}

long pascal streamTell(KVInputStream* stream)
{
    if(!stream || !stream.pInputStreamPrivateData)
    { 
        return FALSE;
    }
    
    StreamInfo* info = (StreamInfo*)stream.pInputStreamPrivateData;

    return ftell(info.fp); 
}

BOOL pascal fpClose(struct tag_InputStream *)
{
    if(!stream || !stream.pInputStreamPrivateData)
    { 
        return FALSE;
    }
    
    StreamInfo* info = (StreamInfo*)stream.pInputStreamPrivateData;

    return f
    close(info.fp) == 0;
}

StreamInfo info = {pathToInputFile, NULL};
stream.pInputStreamPrivateData = &info;
stream.lcbFilesize = 0;
stream.fpOpen = streamOpen;
stream.fpRead = streamRead;
stream.fpSeek = streamSeek;
stream.fpTell = streamTell;
stream.fpClose = streamClose;
```

If you already know the size of the document when you create the stream, you can use this information to fill out the lcbFilesize member. This option can reduce the number of seeks required, because KeyView does not need to seek to the end of the file to determine the size.

If you do not know the size, you **must** set this member to zero. Failure to set this member will result in undefined behavior.

> **Files As Streams:** The above code has been written as an illustration, but there might be situations where you do actually want to operate on files on disk, but using the stream API. Rather than needing to redefine the code above, you can use the interface function [fpFileToInputStreamCreate()](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_13/KeyviewFilterSDK_12.13_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/index.html#C/filtering_functions/fpFiletoInputStreamCreate.htm).

### Using streams for detection and metadata

After you define a stream, you can adapt your existing code to use streams fairly easily. Several KeyView operations have equivalent functions for taking a stream, and work in the same way as the file-based counterparts.

```c
success = filter.fpGetDocInfoStream(context, &stream, &adInfo);
error = filter.fpGetOLESummaryInfo(context, &stream, &summaryInfo);
error = filter.fpGetXmpInfo(context, &stream, &xmpInfo, 1);
```

Filtering text and extracting sub files, on the other hand, have a slightly different interface, which offers more flexibility and can improve performance.

### Filtering text using streams

Before you filter a stream, you must first open the stream. You must also close it after use.

```c
void* streamContext = NULL;
streamContext = filter.fpOpenStream(context, &stream);
if(!streamContext)
{
    //handle error
}

//Use stream

filter.fpCloseStream(context, streamContext);
```

You can then pass this context to [fpCanFilterStream](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_13/KeyviewFilterSDK_12.13_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/index.html#C/filtering_functions/fpCanFilterStream.htm), the equivalent of fpCanFilterFile.

```c
error = filter.fpCanFilterStream(context, streamContext);
```

Filtering text occurs slightly differently. Rather than filtering all the text in one go, KeyView outputs the text in chunks, by filling out a [KVFilterOutput](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_13/KeyviewFilterSDK_12.13_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/index.html#C/filtering_structures/KVFilterOutput.htm) structure. You must also free this structure.

The end of the stream is indicated by an empty KVFilterOutput structure. You do not need to free the empty structure.

```c
while(1)
{
    KVFilterOutput output = {0};
        
    error = filter->fpFilterStream(context, streamContext, &output, NULL);
    
    if(error != KVERR_Success)
    {
        return errorCode(filter, context, error);
    }
    
    if(output.cbText == 0)
    {
        break;
    }

    //Use filter output

    filter->fpFreeFilterOutput(context, &output);
}
```

> **Partial Filtering:** Because KeyView returns the filter stream output in chunks, you might find you have received all the information you need before you have filtered the entire file. In this case, you might be able to increase throughput by stopping filtering early. This is safe to do, as long as you still call [fpFreeFilterOutput()](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_13/KeyviewFilterSDK_12.13_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/index.html#C/filtering_functions/fpFreeFilterOutput.htm) and [fpCloseStream()](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_13/KeyviewFilterSDK_12.13_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/index.html#C/filtering_functions/fpCloseStream.htm).

### Extracting sub files using streams

You can open the main file in a stream rather than a file, by filling out the stream member of [KVOpenFileArgRec](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_13/KeyviewFilterSDK_12.13_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/index.html#kv_xtract_structures/_KV_XTRACT_struct_KVOpenFileArg.htm), rather than the filePath member.

```c
openArg.stream = &stream;
```

KeyView also lets you access the sub files as streams, rather than needing to extract them to disk. Because some KeyView operations do not need to read the entire file, you might get a performance benefit by avoiding the need to extract all the data from the file.

To access a sub file as a stream, use the [fpOpenSubFile()](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_13/KeyviewFilterSDK_12.13_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/index.html#kv_xtract_functions/_KV_XTRACT_funct_fpOpenSubFile.htm) function, rather than using `fpExtractSubFile()`. The [KVExtractSubFileArgRec](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_13/KeyviewFilterSDK_12.13_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/index.html#kv_xtract_structures/_KV_XTRACT_struct_KVExtractSubFileArg.htm) is the same as before.

```c
KVInputStream substream = NULL;
error = extract.fpOpenSubFile(fileContext, &extractArg, &substream);

//Use sub file stream

extract.fpCloseSubFile(substream);
```

You can use the [fpGetExtractInfo](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_13/KeyviewFilterSDK_12.13_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/index.html#kv_xtract_functions/_KV_XTRACT_funct_fpGetExtractInfo.htm) function to retrieve the KVSubFileExtractInfo structure associated with the subfile, and the [fpGetExtractStatus()](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_13/KeyviewFilterSDK_12.13_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/index.html#kv_xtract_functions/_KV_XTRACT_funct_fpGetExtractStatus.htm) function to return more information about any errors encountered when using the sub file stream.

When you parse this stream back into the KeyView Filter interface, it must be on a different context to the one that started the Extract session. Because initializing a new context can incur a performance cost, we recommend that you do this once, and then reuse this context for each sub file.

## Security

This section outlines some security best practices to consider when using KeyView.

### DLL pre-loading attacks

The examples in the C programming tutorial assume that your application executable is located in the same directory as `kvfilter.dll` / `kvfilter.so` and the other KeyView binaries. If kvfilter is not present for some reason, the Operating System searches various other locations for it. This can be convenient during development but:

* it can lead to DLL pre-loading attacks if an attacker is able to place a malicious binary in one of the locations searched.
* it can lead to unexpected results if a different version of KeyView is present in one of the locations searched.

#### Embedding a manifest on Windows

On Windows you can mitigate against this threat by embedding a manifest in your executable so that Windows will only search for `kvfilter.dll` in its expected location.  For example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0">
    <file name="kvfilter.dll" />
</assembly>
```

#### Loading with absolute paths

On Windows, if you load kvfilter.dll with `LoadLibrary` instead of using the import library, consider using an absolute path to prevent Windows searching for the library in other locations.

On other platforms, if you load kvfilter.so with `dlopen` instead of including it in the linker command, consider using an absolute path to prevent the OS from searching in other locations.

### Calling KeyView from an application with elevated privileges

Following security best practice for any application, we recommend that you run KeyView with minimal privileges. If your application requires root or Administrator privileges then we suggest that you drop those before calling KeyView. If for some reason you are unable to do that (for example, if the elevated privileges are required again after the call to KeyView), we recommend that you look at [Run KeyView with Reduced Privileges](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_13/KeyviewFilterSDK_12.13_Documentation/Guides/html/c-programming/index.html#C/filter_api/Run_KeyView_Reduced_Privileges.htm), which explains how to configure KeyView to process files with minimal privileges, even when called from an application with elevated privileges.

## Conclusion

You should now have a good understanding of the KeyView Filter SDK API, allowing youto automatically detect the file format and extract metadata, text and sub files.

If you haven't already done so, why not try more tutorials to explore some of the other features available in KeyView Filter SDK, linked from the [main page](../../README.md#keyview-filter-sdk-showcase).
