## Introduction

These lessons assume that you have completed the [Filter SDK](../keyview_filter/README.md) and [Eduction SDK](../eduction/README.md) Introduction lessons and the SDK programming related ones.

## Use the Filter SDK and Eduction SDK

Eduction expects UTF-8 text as its input.  The Filter SDK is a natural fit to process supported file formats, extracting text as UTF-8.

### Python API

[Get started](./programming_python.md).
